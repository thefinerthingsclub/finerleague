- Single use components should be created in the core module (nav, spinners, message-toasts, modal-dialogs ...).
- This module should be started just one time in the AppModule and never import it anywhere else.
- CoreModule will contain singleton services whose instance wil be shared throughout the application (e.g. ExceptionService and LoggerService).
